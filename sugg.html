		<h2>Remember</h2>
		<p>The amount of energy you need each day to maintain your weight depends on your age, gender, height, weight and physical activity level.</p>
		<p>Women probably shouldn't eat less than 1200cal/day on average and men 1500cal/day for nutritional reasons; unless they are under the watch of a medical professional.</p>
		<p>It's important to remember that the Daily Intake tracker is just that - a tracker. The DI values should be used as a guide to help you make informed choices about the foods you eat.</p>
		<p>If you are unsure of how to interpret this information, consult a dietitian or your GP for your own personalised advice and guidance.</p>

		<p><h3>Three Most Popular Diets</h3>
			<strong>1.Atkins diet:</strong>The Atkins diet, or Atkins nutritional approach, focuses on controlling the levels of insulin in the body through a low-carbohydrate diet.People on the Atkins diet avoid carbohydrates but can eat as much protein and fat as they like.
			<br><strong>2.Zone Diet:</strong>The Zone diet aims for a nutritional balance of 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent fats, and 30 percent protein in each meal.The Zone diet encourages the consumption of high-quality carbohydrates.
			<br><strong>3.Ketogenic Diet:</strong>It involves reducing carbohydrate intake and upping fat intake. It sounds contrary to common sense, but it allows the body to burn fat as a fuel, rather than carbohydrates.The diet causes the break down of fat deposits for fuel and creates substances called ketones through a process called ketosis.
		</p>
		<p><h3>Significance of BMR</h3>
			<strong>BMR shows how many calories you need to take in :</strong>Your BMR + Activity level indicates how many more or less calories you need to include in your diet plan for men. For instance, if you exercise 3 days a week, your daily calorific requirement would come around 2700 calories. So go by the numbers and not your hunger cravings.
			<br><strong>BMR explains how much weight you need to lose/gain :</strong>Depending upon the level of activity and calorific intake, your BMR suggests how much over or under weight you are. It can help you determine your fitness routine.

			<em>
			Most people tend to be able to lose an average 0.5-2lbs/week or 0.5%-1% of their bodyweight at a safe, sustainable level. However, it depends on how much one has to lose. 
			<br>In the first month or so, you might lose more, often due to water weight.
			<br>
			<br>Pick a typical recommendation, like calorie deficit for 1-lb a week. If you're uncomfortable, add in some calories. If not, try cutting 100 calories from your daily average for the week. Keep doing this until you find a comfortable level for your body and lifestyle.
			<br>Remember, many might not feel comfortable eating at higher deficits. That's totally ok. Progress is progress.</em>
