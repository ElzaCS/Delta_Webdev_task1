		<h2>Remember</h2>
		<p>The amount of energy you need each day to maintain your weight depends on your age, gender, height, weight and physical activity level.</p>
		<p>Women probably shouldn't eat less than 1200cal/day on average and men 1500cal/day for nutritional reasons; unless they are under the watch of a medical professional.</p>
		<p>It's important to remember that the Daily Intake tracker is just that - a tracker. The DI values should be used as a guide to help you make informed choices about the foods you eat.</p>
		<p>If you are unsure of how to interpret this information, consult a dietitian or your GP for your own personalised advice and guidance.</p>

	<p>Keeping a track of your daily intake can help you make important decisions regarding your meals.</p>
	<p>To find out how many calories you need per day, calculate your BMR.</p>
